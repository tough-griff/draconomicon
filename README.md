# The Draconomicon

**The Draconomicon** is an open-source, web-based character management platform
for table-top RPGs, especially those following the *d20 system*.

## Recommended tools for development
- [Mailcatcher](https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher) `gem install mailcatcher`
  - Run `mailcatcher` after installing to launch the daemon.
  - You can now browse to http://localhost:1080/ to view the emails that have been sent
- [scss-lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint) `gem install scss-lint`
  - Recommended to be installed globally as `scss-lint` conflicts with `sass-rails`
